	<h2>My Thoughts on Playing the Professional Field</h2>
	<p>
Whether it’s personal or professional, nobody will argue against the idea that relationships are a vital part of our daily lives. The problem, however, is that we love to think that we’re capable of doing it all and doing it all on our own. Whether they’re positive or negative, the relationships we come across in our lives not only teach us about ourselves, but they also teach us how to be better versions of ourselves. That being said, what if I was to suggest that you could make your next job hunt easier on yourself if you thought about it the same way you do dating? I know it sounds weird but bear with me. If look close enough, you’ll notice the similarities between the two are actually pretty striking. Once you do realize those similarities, you’ll come to find that job searching doesn’t seem so serious and so stressful anymore. 
	</p>
	<p>It all begins with the search. You might be out with friends for a night out or maybe you’re just going about your daily routine when all of a sudden, you come across somebody that captures your interest. When it comes to job searching I’ll agree, you’re probably forcing its hand by wanting to find your next opportunity yourself rather than waiting on fate to work its magic. Like anything in life, you plan things to go one way but more than likely, they always end up going another way. You majored in psychology thinking you would be a psychologist but then you soon realize that being a recruiter was a much better fit than you probably ever expected. You told yourself you would never date a person with tattoos but the person that accidentally bumps into you with the artwork on their forearm had intrigued you enough to spark your interest. No matter how much we may try to control it, life has ways of switching things up on us. Sometimes, it’s positive and sometimes it’s negative but regardless, it’s what makes life so exciting. I would never encourage anybody to give up on their career goals by any means, but I’ll always suggest never being afraid to look beyond your original game plan to find unexpected happiness. Life will never punish you for seeking other opportunities as long as you remember to find ones that closely align with your interests & passions in addition to molding you into a better version of yourself.</p>
	<p>Now it’s time to apply! Your search has lead you to what seems like the perfect opportunity. When dating, this means mustering up the courage to talk to the person that’s sparked your initial interest from a distance in hopes of setting up a date. You have no idea how it’s going to turn out but you’ve decided that the risk is well worth the possible reward. As many of us know from past experiences, this could go in two different directions. This person could continue to intrigue you and capture your interest but on the flip side, you may soon realize that this opportunity may not be the right one for you despite your initial feelings. In job searching, it’s the hiring manager or recruiter that makes that determination for us. You decide to go for it and you apply for that job that has captured your interest. You believe it’s the perfect opportunity and you’re feeling more excited than you may have felt in a long time. You sit patiently waiting for the phone to ring or the email icon on your phone to alert you that there’s an unread message. Unfortunately, most of the time that call never comes or you get the dreaded automated email letting you know that you haven’t been selected to move forward. Nobody ever wants to feel rejected whether it be from a possible significant other or that job that seemed just perfect for them and it feels like a punch in the gut. What we all seem to forget though is that the only thing worse than being rejected is never walking up to that person to start the initial conversation or sending that job application in. Even if you get rejected, you have solace in knowing that you’ll never in your life have to wonder what if. The mystery there is non-existent and fate confirmed that it just wasn’t the right opportunity for you. Rather than dwell on it and look at the rejection as a failure, sleep easy knowing that there is something better out there for you. While nobody can predict when it’s going to show itself, just know that life has endless opportunities available to all of us willing to look for them. Why waste time dwelling on one opportunity that didn’t work out when there are so many others waiting to be discovered? Take the negative experience and use it to remind yourself that only a brave person does what you just did. You took a risk, you attempted, and never again will you think back to that specific opportunity wondering that dreaded feeling of not knowing. Without that feeling, you’re truly able to move forward with your life to other opportunities and there will be nothing in your way to obstruct your vision board.</p>
	<p>Now on the flip side, what happens when the initial spark turns into mutual interest? Congratulations, you’ve entered the dating phase. This is always a pretty exciting moment for just about anybody. You took the risk and it seems to actually be paying off pretty well. The mutual interest has completely taken over and you’re both completely distracted by each other. You unknowingly ignore everything else that’s happening around you. The music, the sounds, the lights, none of those outside variables seem to really matter much as you both continue to make conversation. You ask each other subtle questions hoping to confirm that those initial feelings can translate into something real and before you know it, you’re setting up a date. A time where you both can sit down one-on-one and reassure yourselves once more that there is a serious possibility there. In the world of job searching, this means you’ve reached the interview phase. You can think of the initial meeting once you’ve sparked their interest as the phone interview. When you meet someone initially, you’re probably going to stick to asking them pretty basic questions to gauge what their personality is like as the recruiter or hiring manager will do with you. If you continue to hold their interest, you’ve passed the phone interview stage and now you’ve made it to the in-person interview or one-on-one date. This is when the neurotic side of you really starts to come out. It seemed so easy at first because you probably didn’t expect anything to come of it but now you've reached a stage you didn’t think you would have. A million questions begin to run through your head at this point. What do I wear? What will we talk about? What does all this mean? Why are they looking at me like that? Did I already screw this up? The important thing to realize once you’ve made it to the first date or in-person interview is that you made it this far for a reason so why be nervous? They made a decision to meet with you when they had so many chances up until this point to pass on you. They could have gone with other options or any of the hundreds or even thousands of other applicants. Remember that they saw something in you that was enough for them to want to spend more time with you. The hardest part is getting the interview, not the actual interview itself so you’ve already crossed the hardest hurdle. Whether it’s a date or a job interview, the number one thing to remember is the age-old advice of just being yourself and selling the best version of yourself. Wear the clothing that makes you feel most confident, remind yourself that you made it this far by just being yourself and that it wasn’t just a stroke of luck, and always remember that it’s natural to be a little nervous but nervousness will never win you a second date or the job offer quite like natural confidence will. </p>
	<p>Search for your next opportunity but keep your eyes open to the ones you thought you’d never consider before. Apply for that opportunity when you find it knowing that only failed if you didn’t at least attempt. Go into that one-on-one meeting knowing that you’ve made it this far because of your unique qualities. You’re presented with opportunities that could change your life every single day and most of the time, you don’t even realize it. Every connection we make in our lives happen for a reason regardless of whether they have something positive to offer us or we have something positive to offer them. That being said, job searching seems a little less painful and lot more entertaining when we equate it to something as carefree as dating. We don’t wake up every day with the expectation that we’re going to find our next significant other before the end of the day, rather we let it occur naturally. Sure, we may force its hand a little but like dating, job searching works best when you don’t let it consume your life. Don’t focus so much on that one opportunity that seemed perfect for you. Always keep your eyes and ears open to all of the other opportunities out there and the most important piece of advice to remember is to be patient with the process. Don’t ever allow yourself to feel discouraged and always remember that every day brings new possibilities that the previous day didn’t. Like dating, it’s important to find a job and company that will see the great qualities you have to offer and also appreciate them as well. Don’t forget that you do have something unique to offer the world and you’re not like every other person out there. No matter how tough times may get and how many times you feel as though you’re trying to go one step forward but keep going two steps back, we need the negative experiences in our lives to make us appreciate the good times when we finally get to where we want to be in our life both personally and professionally.</p>
