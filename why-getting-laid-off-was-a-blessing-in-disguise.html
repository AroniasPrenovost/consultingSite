	<h2>Taking Care of Yourself Can Pay in The Long Run</h2>
	<p>The end of 2014 is a time in my life that I’ll never quite shake off no matter how far I’ve come in my career. Now almost 3 years later, it’s a reminder of how far I’ve come since that time and what opportunities I’ve been afforded since then. Getting laid off was something I naively thought I wouldn’t have to deal with until I was much older and advanced in my career. I was 24 and about 2 years out of college when it happened and it was difficult for me to try to find any positives in the situation while my days were consumed with a mix of shock, sadness, and denial. Little did I know that dark cloud that hovered above me would eventually be the best thing to ever happen to my career as well as my life outside of the office.</p>
	<p>There was always a vision of what I thought my adult life would look like when I was younger. I always wanted to be the guy that wore suits every day to work. I always wanted to know what it was like to work in a fancy building downtown. I always wanted to live in a home high in the sky with plenty of windows so I could look out at the view of the skyscrapers & Seattle landmarks and remind myself daily that I had made my fantasy a reality. My childhood vision would eventually become my reality at the age of 23 working in sales. I worked downtown, and I lived downtown, living the life I had always wanted to. I didn’t pay much attention to what was happening around me because I was living in my little dream world. I know this because had I been paying more attention, I would’ve known that just because I could technically afford to live alone in a studio apartment on the 14th floor, didn’t mean that I had to do it. I would have prepared a rainy-day fund rather than thinking the paychecks would always come. I was living my dream, but I was living it at the wrong phase in my life. I was a very dangerous combination of immature and naïve and getting laid off was the most humbling life experience I never realized I needed.</p>
	<p>I don’t think you ever really forget that feeling you get when you find out you’re getting laid off. It’s a feeling of initial shock, anger at yourself for not seeing it coming, a wonder of what the future holds, and fear that it could happen again once you do find a new position. As much as I never wanted to admit it, your job is a major part of your life considering 8 of more hours of your day during the work week is dedicated to working. I spent the first couple weeks sitting in my apartment in denial but soon that turned to worry as I struggled with the stress of trying to figure out what I was going to do next. I wondered how I was going to maintain my dream world I had worked so hard to build. My former employer handled it in the most caring and professional way you can but that didn’t offer me much solace in that moment or the weeks after. I was not in a position to immediately jump back into another job and I think it showed despite desperate attempts to hide it during the few job interviews I was able to secure but failed to make much of. My lease was up and I couldn’t afford to keep my apartment and with that, I lost the very thing that gave me my sense of pride and accomplishment. In just a year and a half, I had lost the two things that meant the most to me, my job and my apartment. I had to move back home with my parents and the prospects of a new job looked slim. I began to destroy myself by wallowing in my own self-pity. I slept in late, I ate terribly and wasn’t going outside and experiencing life as I rarely left my room. With an amazing support system, I was able to see after some time that feeling sorry for myself hadn’t made me feel much better. I was still left in the same position that I was in when I was initially let go and hadn’t progressed much. I knew that if I wanted to make a change in my life, I needed a new approach and a different outlook on the situation.</p>
	<p>As soon as I quit feeling sorry for myself, everything else seemed to just fall into place much easier. I started waking up at 7 am every day; I was eating better, going out on runs to help me clear my head, and any other activities I could think of doing to keep myself feeling accomplished. I also began taking a new approach to job searching by giving the search structure and only searching during a set time frame to keep myself balanced as well as utilizing my network for assistance. Once I let my guard down and realized that I couldn’t do it all on my own, I reached out for help and saw just how willing the surrounding people were to assist me in the search. I eventually found a job about 4 months later which led me to my next permanent position and now I’m working at a company that I had wanted to work with since graduating in 2012. Needless to say, I couldn’t be happier with where I’m at today. The experience and skills I took from the job that I lost actually helped me get the positions that led me to where I’m at today. More than that, it forced me to grow up and take the things in my life I never thought about a lot more seriously. I learned the importance of having a rainy-day fund and always be prepared since these types of situations are always difficult to predict. I also learned that I could be just as happy living just outside of the city with a roommate vs. spending more money to be in the middle of the city alone. More importantly, I learned to be humble and to appreciate every job I’ve worked at since realizing the hard way that it could be taken away as soon as I got too comfortable.</p>
	<p>There was an initial fear in writing this article for the public to see. It’s never easy admitting your faults and reliving previous mistakes you’ve made. I can’t say that I wrote this article without stopping a few times to wonder what I was thinking with regard to the decisions I was making and not making. I made a lot of mistakes but getting laid off from my job eventually led me to figure out how to fix them. While it did take some time, I can confidently say that losing my job helped me grow into a better person. I have a much greater respect for my career, for money, and for my overall priorities in life. For anybody dealing with the effects of getting laid off from their job, the best advice I can give is to realize that while it may not feel like it, you’ve gained more than you’ve lost. Staying positive is the most important thing you can do for yourself. A positive attitude is going to give you the push and the drive to continue applying for jobs even after getting back-to-back rejection emails. Lean on your support system and utilize your network and above all, never forget that you have a lot to offer and there’s a company out there that’s going to realize it in due time. There have been some ups and downs since the loss of my job and to this day, I still feel weird driving by my old apartment building and being reminded of the life that I used to have. That’s the beauty of life though, it’s not about what you used to have but what you have now and what the future holds for you. I know there’s a bright future ahead but I also know that I’ll be better prepared for it and I have getting laid off to thank for that.</p>
