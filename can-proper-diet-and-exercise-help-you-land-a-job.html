	<h2>Taking Care of Yourself Can Pay in The Long Run</h2>
	<p>
Job searching is without a doubt, one of the most stressful things we will ever do in our adult lives. For many people, their career is a part of their identity. It’s who they are, who they want to be known as, and even a reminder of one of the many reasons they’re put on this earth, to begin with. For others, it’s simply a way to survive and pay the bills, nothing more and nothing less. These reasons combined are what makes being without a job or searching for a better job a very painful and stressful ordeal for many of us, myself included. It’s the fears that hold us back from quitting the job we know deep down isn’t working out for the best or graduating and realizing that one of the biggest decisions we’ve ever had to make in our lives is truly our own with nobody to tell us what exactly it is. Since graduating college at the end of 2012, I've had my fair share of ups and downs but I have also found ways of coping with the stress recently that I never thought possible before. Maybe because for the first time, I finally figured out that I had to put myself first before my job search to be successful. This meant re-evaluating my approach and sharing it with others who share in my similar situation of not having a job, not being happy at their current job and even those who wonder what direction their career was meant to go.
	</p>
	<p>Whether we want to believe it or not, the types of food we eat and the amount of exercise we get on a daily basis has a direct correlation to our job searching efforts. When I left my last position, I decided to try a completely different approach to my job search. I stepped away from the computer and focused on me. I began this journey by picking up a book titled "The Sell" by Fredrik Eklund, star of Bravo’s “Million Dollar Listing – New York.” His book inspired me in ways I never thought possible. One of the biggest ways being that he made me believe that the most successful people in this world are also the healthiest. So, I began a journey that a former junk food junkie such as myself never thought possible to ever conquer.</p>
	<p>I saw the importance of eating at home versus settling for the conveniences of fast food, but I also remind myself that it’s okay to treat yourself every once in a while. Eating healthy should feel fun and not a task. When it becomes a chore, it leads to boredom which in turn leads to failure. I go by the 80/20 rule when it comes to food meaning I eat healthy 80% of the time while treating myself about 20% of the time. This means on the weekends, if I want to get a burger then I would get a burger but instead of a double bacon burger, I would choose a grilled chicken burger with no mayo, extra lettuce & tomato, and nix the fries for another healthier alternative or nothing at all. This also meant when dessert time came that I would have one apple pie for example instead of the two they try to offer you because it’s “cheaper.” Nobody needs two apple pies, even if it is your cheat day. Remember that while you think you’re saving money in the moment, you pay for it with your health later. As I’ve been doing this for a couple of months now, I began to notice that with time I don’t look forward to my cheat days now like I did in the beginning. After eating right and exercising 4-5 times a week, it’s just not worth it to me to erase all of the hard work and now that 20% is turning into 10% and continuing to drop. This now brings me to my next point, exercise.</p>

This now brings me to my next point, exercise.</p>
	<p>I have a sort of love-hate relationship with the gym that most people that have ever walked inside a gym could probably relate to. I hate it but it loves me and it’s pretty easy to figure out why. Regardless of how many times I come in, they still charge the same monthly price whether its once a day, once a week or once a month. The gym is also one of the easiest things in our life to come up with excuses for as to why we don’t want to go. Everything from not having enough time, to being too tired, or whatever else you can come up with but believe me when I say I’ve been there and I understand. So, what does exercise have to do with job searching? Anything in life when thought about or done too much can cause us to burn out and that includes job searching. We put all of our time and focus on looking for a job that we forget to give our bodies the attention it needs and deserves. The mental benefits of exercise have been proven time and time again. The release of serotonin and endorphins while exercising improves our mood greatly. When you’re in a happier mood, you’re more optimistic on what life has to offer in the future and you’re more likely to look at your search with a whole new positive outlook. Then, of course, you have the physical benefits. When you look good, you feel good and when you feel good, you’re more confident. Job interviews, whether over the phone or in person aren’t just about seeing whether your skills are right for the job. Hiring managers want to hire someone who is confident in themselves because it will lead them to believe if they hire you, you'll be confident in the work you're producing and you'll be a good return on their investment. That being said, it’s essential that you have everything you need to not just sell yourself, but sell them on the best version of yourself. A strong communicator who has a unique presence the second they step into the room and isn’t afraid to take on even the most difficult interview questions. </p>
	<p>I'm still just in the beginning stages of this process, about 3 months to be exact but I do look forward to later sharing my results and what I’ve learned once I am a little longer into it. I will also say that I am no health and fitness expert by any means and I'm still learning new things regarding how to better myself with my diet and daily exercise routine. This includes experimenting with natural remedies such as drinking Apple Cider Vinegar twice daily after meals. As I have personally experienced though, I have appreciated how much a healthy diet, exercise, and ensuring that you’re getting your 8 hours of sleep every single day is truly essential to your job search. With so much pressure and stress being added to your life every day you go without a job, it’s vital to take the time out for yourself every day to become that better version of yourself that you know lies within. A version that you can present to hiring managers when the time comes to interview with them. Whether you’ll be successful in life or not isn’t pre-determined and neither is the timeline on when you’ll attain it by anything other than your own self. The journey to your dream career is like any road trip. You may hit road blocks on the way to point B but you have the power & the tools to be creative and find detours around them. Just take the time to make sure your car is in good working condition first before heading out.
